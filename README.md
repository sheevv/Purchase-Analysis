# Purchase-Analysis
This mini-project reads data related to purchases made by users of a retail company. The data contains columns bellow:
* order_id: Id of the purchase made by user
* date: Date of the purchase
* user_id: Id of the user purchase a product or service
* total_purchase: Total amount of product or service bought by the user in a specific date
* latitude and longitude

With these data in hand, our aim is to answer three main questions:
+ What is the mean and standard deviation of total purchases made by users per day of week?
+ How is the distribution of total purchases made by users in weekends and working days?
+ RFM Clustering of the purchases made by users to get an insight about their purchases.

Bellow I have provided a web based application written in Flask, Python to represent the results.
